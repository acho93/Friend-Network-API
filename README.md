# Friend-Network-API

## Description
For this challenge, I was tasked with creating APIs for the back end CRUD operations of a social media network. Using Mongoose and MongoDB, I created databases that updated and stored information whenever users created, updated, or deleted usernames and "thoughts". There is also functionality that allows users to add and remove friends from their profiles, as well as add and remove reactions to different "thoughts" that were posted on this platform.

Here is a video of how it functions: https://youtu.be/hDDYZ8HECMY

## Installation
You will need to run `npm init` to install all dependencies, which include Express and Mongoose (`npm install mongoose express`).

## Usage
After installing necessary dependencies, run `npm start`. The application will start and allow the user to view and modify users, friends, thoughts, and reactions.
